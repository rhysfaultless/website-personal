# Rhys's website

## Why?

1. Writing helps me retain knowledge.
2. This allows me to store different types of data in a central place. ( Books, articles, my project insights, my preocesses)
3. I can send links to other people. I have found Trello and Docs to be great tools, but it is difficult to share the data that I have amassed using these tools.

## Tools used:
1. [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
2. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
3. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
