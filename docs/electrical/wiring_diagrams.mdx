Wiring diagrams are more detailed than functional block diagrams.
Wiring diagrams show all the cables and wiring harnesses between subassemblies in the system.

For a simple example, lets consider the setup of a desktop computer.
There are the main subassemblies, and interfaces:

1. AC electrical wall outlet
2. Ethernet switch or router
3. Computer tower
4. Monitor
5. Mouse
6. Keyboard
7. Camera
8. Speaker
9. Microphone

A wiring diagram will show a box for each of the subassemblies, but should include labeled jacks for where cables can be connected.

[//]: # "TODO, add a drawing of the system"

This wiring diagram shows the interconnectons between these subassembies in the system, and how they interface with elements at the edge of the system. Notice that the Speaker and Microphone share a common audio jack on the computer.
I don't think this is indicative of a real computer setup, but was a way to show a wye-cable / wiring-harness in a block diagram.

A wiring diagram does not show details of the subassemblies, or of the cables themselves.
Their purpose is at a high level to see all the physical interconnections between subassemblies.
This means a wiring diagram is not sufficient to show the dependencies between subassemblies in software.
Here are two examples of wiring diagrams, which cannot show how data is passed beteen hardware devices.

[//]: # "TODO, add a drawing of a 3 node CANbus, with the middle device having two jacks"

## what is the purpose of a wiring diagram

A wiring diagram should be the top level hardware drawing for the system.
It has item-number-balloons or find-number-balloons indicating the necessary subassemblies, cables, and harnesses.
These items and quantities should be aligned with the parts list for the top level item being described.
