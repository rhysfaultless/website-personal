There are a few tasks that mechanical designers perform on small mobile robots:

- Structure and bracket design (including welding and fastening).
- Rotating machinery design (bearings, gears, belts and pulleys, gearmotormotor selection)
- Hydraylic and pneumatic design (on occasion for add on tools, and braking substems for large vehicles)
- Thermal designs (cooling electronics, and sometimes heating batteries)
- Design for manufacture (methods of metal fabrication, keyed joints)

<br />{" "}

To complete these tasks, designers use:

- CAD programs like Solidworks or Siemens NX for 3d modeling, drafting, and simulation.
- Calculation tools including simulations, and spreadsheets
- Drafting and Tolerancing standards, like the ASME Y14 standards used in the USA and Canada.
  - **Y14.5** Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T)
  - **Y14.100** Engineering Drawing Practices
  - **Y14.1** Drawing Sheet Size and Format
  - **Y14.2** Line Conventions and Lettering
- Parts catalogs, such as:
