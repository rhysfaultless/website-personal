# Virtual Items

Virtual items ways to simplify a large assembly into an abstraction.
An example is the Lights Subsystem of a car.
This subsystem has a parts-list of items that have a physical form:

- Plastic enclosures
- Fasteners
- Cables
- Printed Circuit Boards

This abstaraction allows a system designer to simplify the set of constraints and requirements related to that aspect of the design.
This also benefits the designer, as they can create drawings, technical writing documents, and interface control documents to state how the subsystem functions.
This abstration is very important for large projects with multiple design teams ( internal or contracted ).

Some common names for virtual items are systems, subsystems, and installations.
