## Background

Bus bars and cables are electrical conductors that move current from _Point A→Point B_.

### Bus Bars

A bus bar is an object made from a sheet of copper.
It typically has through holes where terminates, at its simplest it has a hole for _Point A_ and one for _Point B_.
The bus bar's form may become complex—with multiple turns and bends—depending on where the terminations _Point A_ and _Point B_ are positioned.

### Cables

Cables and Wires are synonymous for this description (_though cables sometimes refer to routings with multiple wires wrapped in a single jacket_).
For this desription; a cable is a single confuctor, with an insulation jacket.
In vehicle design, a cable is always stranded, since solid core cables fail over time due to fatigue from vibration.
Cables are rarely soldered or welded at their terminations, _Points A_ and _B_.
Cables that conduct large currents are terminated with a crimp, like a Ring Terminal or Lug.

## Compare

Both bus bars and cables accomplish the main goal of moving an electric current from _Point A_ to _Point B_.
Choosing between the 2 is often an intuitive design decision, but these are the main considerations for a trade study:
