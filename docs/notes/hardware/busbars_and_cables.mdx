title: Bus Bars and Cables
sidebar_label: Bus Bars & Cables
---

## Background

Bus bars and cables are electrical conductors, that move current from _Point A→Point B_.

### Bus Bars

A bus bar is a shape made from a sheet of copper.
It typically has holes for where is terminates, at its simplest it has a hole for _Point A_ and one for _Point B_.
Depending on the complexity of where _Point A_ and _Point B_ are relative to eachother, the bus bar may have bends, and insulating material.

### Cables

Cables and Wires are synonymous for this description
(_though cables sometimes refer to routings with multiple wires wrapped in a single jacket_).
For this desription; a Cable is a single confuctor, with an insulating jacket.
In mobile robotics, a cable is always stranded, since solid core cables fail over time due to fatigue from vibration.
Cables are rarely soldered or welded at their termination, _Points A_ and _B_.
Cables that conduct large currents are terminated with a crimp, like a Ring Terminal or Lug.

## Compare

Both bus bars and calbes accomplish the main goal, of moving an electric current from _Point A_ to _Point B_.
Choosing between the two is often an intuitive design decision, but these are the main TODO to consider in this trade study:
