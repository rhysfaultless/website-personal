## Quotes

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "Two minutes with a pencil on the back of an envelope let's us solve problems which we would could not do in our heads if we tried for a hundred years. ",
    "But at present we have no corresponding way of simplifying design problems for ourselves."

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "The modern designer relies more and more on his position as an 'artist', on catchwords, personal idiom, and intuition — for all these relieve him of some of the burden of decision, and make his cognitive problems manageable. ",
    "Driven on his own resources, unable to cope with the complicated information he is supposed to organize, he hides his incompetence in a frenzy of artistic individuality."

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "What does make design a problem in real world cases is that we are trying to make a diagram for forces whose field we do not understand. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "For although only few men have sufficient integrative ability to invent form of any clarity, we are all able to criticize existing forms. ",
    "It is especially important to understand that the agent in such a process needs no creative strength. ",
    "He does not need to be able to improve the form, only to make some sort of change when he notices a failure. ",
    "The changes may not be always for the better; but it is not necessary that they should be, since the operation of the process allows only the improvements to persist. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "By erecting such a hierarchy of concepts for himself, the designer is, after all, able to face the problem all at once. ",
    "He achieves a powerful economy of thought, and can by this means thread his way through far more difficult problems than he could cope with otherwise. ",
    "If hierarchies seem less common in practice than I seem to suggest, we have only to look at the contents of an engineering manual for architects' catalogue; the hierarchy of chapter headings and subheadings is organized the way it is, precisely for cognitive convenience. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "These principles are at the root of all so-called 'theories' of architectural design. ",
    "They are prescriptions which relieve the burden of self-consciousness and of too much responsibility. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "The right way is the residue when all the wrong ways are eradicated. ",
    "But in an intellectual atmosphere free from the inhibition of tradition, the picture changes. ",
    "The moment the student is free to question what he has told, and value is put on explanation, it becomes important to decide why 'this' is the right way rather than 'that', and to look for general reasons. ",
    "Attempts are made to aggregate the specific failures and successes in which occur, into principles. ",
    "And each such general principle now takes the place of many separate and specific admonitions. ",
    "It tells us to avoid this kind of form, perhaps, or praises that kind. With failure and success defined, the training of the architect develops rapidly. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "The data alone are not enough to define a hypothesis; the construction of hypotheses demands the further introduction of principles like simplicity (Occam's razor), non-arbitrariness, and clear organization. ",
    "The construction of form, too, requires these principles. ",
    "There is that present no prospect of introducing these principles mechanically, either into science or into design. ",
    "Again, they require invention. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "In all these cases, the invention is based on a hunch which actually makes it easier to understand the problem. ",
    "Like such a hunch, a constructive diagram will often proceed the precise knowledge which could prescribe its shape on rational grounds. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "It may be given a name, perhaps like 'kettle' or 'town', to make the problem specific; but one of the designer's first tasks will be to strip the problem of the preconceptions which such names introduce. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "We cannot admit 'economically satisfactory' as one requirement, and 'maintenance costs low enough' as another. ",
    "Plainly these have different degrees of significance, because the second is part of the first, while the first is not part of the second. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "A considerable amount of energy must be spent in the preliminary stages shuffling and reshuffling the variables in this fashion, until they are as independent as they can be made. "
