<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "The term 'quality' cannot be intellectually transcended because it is both indefinable and infinitely definable (which amounts to the same thing). ",
    "If it is summed up, the intellectual summary will not be superior to the term because the antithesis of the summary will be as true as the summary itself. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "Quality is not a thing. ",
    "It is an event. ",
    "It is the event at which the subject becomes aware of the object. ",
    "And because without objects there can be no subject—because the objects create subjects' awareness of himself—Quality is the event at which awareness of both subjects and objects is made possible. ",
    "This means quality is not just the result of a collision between subject and object. ",
    "The very existence of subject and object themselves is deduced from the quality event. ",
    "The quality of the event is the cause of the subjects and objects, which are then mistakenly presumed to be the cause of the quality! "

    "'Unask the question' is what it says. "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "I think that our traditional Western way is to try to capture life in a net of words. ",
    "But I think one can realize that the net of words is part a part of life. ",
    "The danger is not in using the words; the danger is in clinging to them, clinging to their meaning, and saying, 'Oh, now I have spoken a great truth.' "

<BookQuote
  quote={[
    "The difference between a good mechanic and a bad one, like the difference between a good mathematician and a bad one, is precisely this ability to select the good facts from the bad ones on the basis of quality. ",
