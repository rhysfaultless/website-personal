## To review before travel

1.  **Passport**, check that it does not expire for at least 6 months past the date of travel.
    For example:
    - Travelling on October 1 2022.
    - Passport expiry date should be no earlier than April 1 2023.
2.  **Visa**, for non-remunerated busineess or tourism.
    You may need to apply for this in advance of your trip.
    Review the websites of the destination country's consulates or embasy.
3.  **Travel letter** from Human Resources describing the purpose of the trip if you are travelling with a business visa.
    This is not strictly necessary, but it can help the customs officer understand why you are visiting their county, and show that the purpose of your travel is for non-runerative business.
4.  **Purchase order** for the related project. Similar to the _travel letter_, this helps show that you are assisting a local business, and that the trip is not a payable line-item on the contract.
5.  **Site access forms** for the Customer's workplace.
6.  **Hotel booking confirmation**.
    This also helps prove to the customs officer that you will not be a burden on their country's social assistance system.
7.  **Vaccination status**.
8.  ~~**Disease testing report**~~ _(Update Autumn 2022 not typically required anymore)_
9.  ~~**Quarentine plan**~~ _(Update Autumn 2022 not typically required anymore)_
10. Flight check-in.
    Most airlines allow you to check-in 24 hours before your flight.
    This guarantees your seat on the plane, incase it is overbooked.
    You can go to the airport without checking-in in advace, but it it an unnecessary risk to take.
11. Contacting your bank and credit card company to mention the travel period.
12. Getting a phone SIM card, or setting up a roaming package with your usual carrier.

## My checklist for packing

This list helps me prepare for my departure flight, and also for when I am repacking for the return flight:

#### Personal article

1.  Passport and visa
2.  Phone
    - USB-C cable
    - Airline check-in confirmation on my phone
3.  Wallet
    - Money for both countries
    - Credit card
    - Back card
    - Identification, other than your passport
    - Business cards
4.  Laptop
    - Charger
    - Mouse
    - Cables, adapters, and peripherals for whatever your tasks are (CANbus, network cable, travel keyboard, 3d mouse, etc)
5.  Charging adapter, based on the destination country
6.  Headphones
7.  Book
8.  Neck pillow (+8 hour flight)
9.  Eye cover (+8 hour flight)

#### Standard Article ( Carry-on Luggage)

10. Identification and travel itinerary inside the suitcase. This can help airlines return your luggage if it was lost.
    - Your name
    - Your address
    - Hotel names, addresses, and dates of where your are staying 
11. Toiletries
12. Clothes
13. Shoes (if required: dress shoes, work boots, etc)

## Other things that are good practice:

- Scan your passport and save a copy to your phone and to Google Drive.
- Review the airline's rules about luggage sizes and weights.
  An oversized carry on usually means you will have to put it in checked luggage, so that adds 30 minutes of waiting at the destination airport's carousel to retreive your bag.
  Overweight checked items usually have an extra fee; $100 for Air Canada in Autumn 2022.

  :::note

  Many 20-inch carry on bags sold in Canada are oversized per Air Canada's 2022 rules.
  It is good to confirm that the external dimensions of the bag you are buying are smaller than the current rules for your airline.
