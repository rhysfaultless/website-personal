Ethernet, TCP, and IP are hardware and protocols to send data between devices like computers, microcontrollers, and sensors.
I see this as the most common way to connect devices for robotics applications, though other protocols like CAN are used.

## Speed

Ethernet typically connects two devices using a 8 wires.
These wires are separated into twisted pairs, so a common cable will have 4 sets of twisted-pair wires.
A twisted-pair has a send and a receive wire ( TX and RX ).
The twisting is a way to reduce noise in the data, due to electro-magnetic interference.

It is common to see a cable marked as _Cat 5_ or _Cat 6_.
These CAT standards are related to how tight the twisting pitch is on the wires, and the rigor involved in adding connectors to the ends of the cable.
_Cat 7_ has a tighter pitch than _Cat 6_, and _Cat 6_ has a tighter pitch than _Cat 5_.
This tigher pitch minimizes induced noise when the data is deing sent at higher frequencies.

- _Cat 4_ for 100 Mbit/s
- _Cat 5_ for 1 Gbit/s
- _Cat 6_ for 2.5 Gbit/s
- _Cat 7_ for 10 Gbit/s
- _Cat 8_ for 40 Gbi/s

:::note

These are just suggestions when quickly choosing a cable.
For example, a _Cat 5_ cable can send data at 2.5 Gbit/s across a 3 metre cable, in a non-electrically-noisy environment.

## Connectors

- RJ45 connector, with 4 twisted-pairs arranged in a T568B termination order.
  This is the most common connector for non-waterproof applications.
  :::note

  It does not matter if a cable is terminated in a T568A or T568B order, as long as both ends of the cable follow the same standard.
  These considerations were more important when designers needed to consider crossover cables, and what device was upstream.
  Crossover cables are not required anymore, since all modern computers, switches, and routers perform this crossover through hardware on their circuit boards.

  :::

- M8-A connector, with 2 twisted-pairs, and is limited to a 100 Mbit/s.
- M8-D connector, with 2 twisted-pairs, and is limited to a 100 Mbit/s.
- M12-D connector, with 2 twisted-pairs, and is limited to a 100 Mbit/s.
- M12-X connector, with 4 twisted-pairs, for up to 10 Gbit/s.
- MIL-DTL-38999 in a 23-09 arrangement, with 4 twisted pairs, for up to 1 Gbit/s speed, if there is only one connector along the connection path.
- MIL-DTL-38999 with an RJ45 female connector inside it (called an RJF or RJFTV connector).
  Speeds are dependent on the terminations inside the RJ45 connector, but are often designed for 1 Gbit/s.

:::note

Ethernet protocols can be emulated over USB and Thunderbolt connections.
This is commonly seen with adapters with a male USB Type-C connector to a female RJ45.
