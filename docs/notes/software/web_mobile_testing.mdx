Google Chrome's developer tools include options to change the window's screen size.
This is useful for testing CSS theme settings in your project.

To change the screen size in Chrome:

1.  Enter the developer tools selecting pressing:

    - â‹® which is in the top-right corner,
    - _More Tools_,
    - _Developer Tools_

    <br/>

    :::tip[shortcut]

    |        Windows         |         macOS         |
    | :--------------------: | :-------------------: |
    | _Ctrl_ + _Shift_ + _C_ | _Cmd_ + _Shift_ + _C_ |

    :::

    <br />

2.  Within the _Developer Tools_ panel, click the _Toggle device toolbar_ button.

    <figure>
      <center>
        <img src="/img/web_development_images/chrome_screensize_markup_1.png" />
        <figcaption>
          <em>Toggle device toolbar</em> button
        </figcaption>
      </center>
    </figure>

    <br />

3.  The default _Dimensions_ option is _Responsive_.
    This lets you enter a screen width, such as _320 px_.

    :::note

    _320 px_ width is considered the smallest screen width for mobile devices in 2022.

        <figcaption>Screen width field</figcaption>
      </center>
    </figure>

4.  Instead of _Responsive_ dimensions, you can select a mobile device to emulate.
    This changes the window's width and height to match that device.

    :::note

    There are around 10 devices listed by default, but you can add more by pressing the _Edit..._ button at the bottom of the list.
