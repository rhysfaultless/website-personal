**Router**

_Routers_ assign IP addresses within a LAN.
A _Router_ can connect to a parent LAN or WAN, assuming it is not being used to create an issolated LAN.
Consumer routers are are usually a combination _router_ and wireless _access point_.
Some common configuration parametrs for a _router_ are:

- SSID, if it also a wireless _access point_
- Gateway, the address of the parent LAN network
- Static IP addresses range
- DHCP addresses range

**Switch**

_Switches_ do not assign IP addresses, but do send data between devices based on defined static IP addresses, or DHCP addresses defined by the network's _router_.

**Access Point**

_Access points_ are an antenna for creating a Wi-Fi network.
_Access points_ do not assign IP addresses, unless they are also a _router_.

**Client and Client Bridge**

_Clients_ are an antenna for receiving a Wi-Fi network.
A _Client Bridge_ shares this connection to other wired network devices.
You can think of the _Access Point_ to _Client Bridge_ connection as a virtual network cable between two _Switches_.
