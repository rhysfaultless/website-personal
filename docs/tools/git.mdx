Refer to [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for more details about Git and its usage.

## Git Intallation Process

1.  [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your Operating System
2.  Follow the installation process from the download
3.  Open a terminal, and run:

    ```
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```

    Changing the name values to your actual settings used on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
    My settings are:

    ```
    git config --global user.name "Rhys Faultless"
    git config --global user.email rhysfaultless@gmail.com
    ```

## GitHub Setup

1.  Go to GitHub and create an account.
2.  Login to your account on your browser.
3.  Set up some form of authentication between your development computer and the remote repoistory (GitHub).
    You can create this connection using:

    - Personal Access Token
    - SSH key
    - Logging into GitHub with VS Code
    - GitHub CLI

There are lots of guides to set this up.
Just be aware that certain workplaces or teams may require a specific type of connection, or commits will not be accepted.

## Useful Extensions in VS Code

1.  [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) adds several graphical tools for using Git.
    These are the features I use frequently:

    - Showing remote and local branches in the Source Control area of VS Code
    - Adds a _Compare References_ tools where you can compare versions of the same file side-by-side.
      This allows you wo chose the file, and it's state after two different commits.
    - A visual Git Rebase tool

2.  [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) is a visual way to see the state of Branches.

## Userful Commands (Not in the UI)

| Command                               | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git fetch -p origin`                 | To remove local branches that do not exist remotely                                                                                     |
| `git rebase -i main`                  | compare working branch to _main_ branch, and add any missing commits to the working branch. Change _main_ to the target branche's name. |
| `git push origin development --force` | Force push changes on local copy of _development_ to the remote repository. This will Push even if there are conflicts between commits. |
| `git rebase HEAD~n`                   | Reword commit messages. Substitute _n_ with however many previous commits you want to review.                                           |

## Using Git in your VS Code workflow

There are lots of video tutorials of this process, so I will just briefly jot down the two ways you will use Git:

### Commits directly to the _Main_ branch

The simplest process is commitng directly to your main branch, though this is not a great practice once you are familiar with Git.
The process is:

1.  Clone the repository to your local development computer.
2.  In VS Code, select _File -> Open Folder_, and select the repository that you just cloned.
3.  <br />

    :::

4.  Make a change to a file.
5.  Review the change in the Source Control area of VS Code
6.  Click the _+_ button beside the file to add it to the change that you are packaging.
7.  Type a commit message, describing what you changed.
    These messages help reviewers understand what your change is attempting to accomplish.

    :::tip

    You can add multiple files to a single commit.
    Only do this when multiple file changes are necessary to accomplish the goal described in the commit message.

    :::

    :::tip

    Git restricts you to a message line of 50 characters max.
    You can add new lines by pressing _Shift + Return_.

    :::

8.  Push the change to GitHub.

### Commits to a Feature Development branch

The process is similar to commiting directly to the Main branch, but this is like working on a save-as copy of the repository.
This is important when there are other people working on the same repository as you, or when the main branch is used by your Production department to ship products.
This branch method allows others to review your changes before merging them into the Main branch.
The process is:

1.  Clone the repository to your local development computer.
2.  In VS Code, select _File -> Open Folder_, and select the repository that you just cloned.
3.  Create a new branch.
    You can do this by clicking the branch name in the bottom-left corner of VS Code.
4.  Make a change to a file.
5.  Review the change in the Source Control area of VS Code
6.  Click the _+_ button beside the file to add it to the change that you are packaging.
7.  Type a commit message, describing what you changed.
8.  Push the change to GitHub.
9.  Create a _Pull Request_ in GitHub.
    This is the process of taking all the commited changes ou your Feature Branch, and adding them to another branch, like Main.
    You can create the _Pull Request_ using either:
    - [The GitHub extension for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).
    - From GitHub's website.
      1.  Login to the website.
      2.  Navigate to the repository.
      3.  Go to the branches area.
      4.  Click Create New Pull Request.
10. The Pull Request will need to be reviewed and accepted before your changes get added to the Main branch.
