I have worked for companies that:

1. Build to specification
2. Design and build to customer requirements
3. Design, build, and sell products

I am most interested in the final group, since the task is the most complex system.
At it's simplest, this task is:

1. Seeing a possible market segment, where your experience and resources have value
2. Finding a hole in that market segment, and defining product features to meet that need
3. Defining a concept-of-operations, of how the product will be used
4. Architeching a system
5. Defining a verification test plan
6. Defining the technical requirements
7. Defining a validation test plan
8. Iteratively designing the subsystems ( hardware and software )
9. Performing the validation test plan, and returning to design iteration if necessary.
10. Perfroming the verification test plan, and returning to the technical requirements definition if necessary
