# Interface Controls

- Places where subassemblies or subsystems meet
- typically they are agreed on points of exchange between design elements
- this allows different design-teams to work in isolation, with minimal communication overhead
- examples
  - Boeing 787 picture, wings attach to fuselage
    - constraints
      - allowable deflection
      - allowable mass and CofG
      - allowable space claim
      - fastening points
      - electrical power connectors
      - data connectors
      - fuselage form
      - data protocol and structure
      - fuel line connectors and their positions
    - requirements
      - required lift force
      - required fuel capacity
