# Risk Mitigation

Risks have two components:

1. An event; like a component breaking, an additional cost, a component going end-of-life, or an employee leaving the company.
2. A probability of that event occurring

Forseeing risks can allow us to reduce the probability of them occuring, or have contingency plans to fix the situation.
