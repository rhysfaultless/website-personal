VS Code is a common code ditor.
It is convenient because:

1. [Is available for free on Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
2. It has a good User Interface for managing Git commands, and tracking changes to your files.
3. The file system has a clear tree structure.
4. Has many extensions (code linters and formatters, colour coding your code's text, docker and server tools)
5. Has a terminal that sets the default directory to your working folder.
6. The terminal uses Unix syle commands and directory paths, even on Windows (`~/`, `ls`, `mkdir`)

VS Code's [setup guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) can walk your through the download and installation on your system.
My only suggestion is to not worry about what extensions to add during setup.
Extensions can easily be added and removed through the _Extensions_ area of VS Code's user interface.

The [Git page](./git) of this website will describe how to setup and use Git and GitHub with VS Code.
