This page will detail the design cycle for a [Brushless DC](./motor_control/#motor_control_bldc) motor controller wo be used on a ROS2 robot.

## Concept of Operations (ConOps)

- [ ] Will be used on a differential drive, skid-steer robot
- [ ] Each side of the robot will be driven by a BLDC motor
- [ ] The robot will have a maximum mass of 200 kg
- [ ] The robot should be capable of driving up 60° inclines, with an acceleration of 0.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>
- [ ] Shall be powered by a 24 lead-acid or LiPO<sub>4</sub> battery, with a voltage range of 22 - 30 VDC
- [ ] Shall shunt brake the motor when the controller is not powered (motion-stop state)
- [ ] Will receive velocity commands from ROS2 topic `/cmd_vel` over a CAN or Ethernet connection
- [ ] The controller shall be addressable, based on CAN or Ethernet choice (webpage, DIP switches, etc)
- [ ] Robot shall travel up to 2.5 m/s with a wheel diameter of Ø320 mm (gearmotor output of 2.5 rev/s).
- [ ] Assume a gear ratio of 30:1

## Requirements

- [ ] 16 A continuous operation.
- [ ] 30 A maximum for peak loads.
- [ ] Allowable input voltage of 22 - 30 VDC.
- [ ] Controls a BLDC motor, with a hall-effect encoder.
- [ ] Ethernet or CAN interface (one only).
- [ ] Shall include mounting holes on a 80 mm X 80 mm grid for M5 screws (to mount to the robot chassis).
- [ ] Electrical terminations shall be sufficient size for the 16 A continuous operation (ring terminal, PP15, etc).
- [ ] Shall be capable of delivering 16 A continous current at a 3-phase motor speed of 75 rev/s.
- [ ] Includes provisions for disipating heat (motor drive and motor braking).
- [ ] 2 wire, 24 V brake control, with PWM circuit to reduce holding power consumption.
- [ ] Target cost of less than $100 USD per controller, for a batch of 10.

## Serch for an existing product

I will not spend much time on this section, but it is key to really consider '_does this product already exist_'.
You can never difinitively answer this question, but it it best to spend some time searching for a product would work for your application (even if it does not comply with all your defined requirements).
The main question I ask is, 'will I be disapointed with my effort, if I find an off-the-shelf product resembling what I just spent a month designing?'

:::note

Change '_...a month designing_' to however long you will labour on your project.

:::

For this BLDC controller project, I could only find ROS2 products up to 8 A continuous current, or products not designed for ROS.
I decided not to use a existing controller and write an interpretter for ROS2 because:

- The unit cost per controller would be higher than my intended pricepoint.
- My design is dependent on a single source for components.
- As a small - medium manufacturer, I would not have influence over this OTS supplier, so they could make the BLDC controller obsolete without giving me time for a last-time-buy.
- I had budgetted for the time to design, source, test, and QC a bespoke controller.

## Concepting

Similar to any circuit design, the main concern is selecting the key components that will determine how well the final product aligns with the ConOps.
The key components for this design will be:

1. The BLDC control chip
2. The microcontroller for:
   - Interfacing with the network (Ethernet or CAN)
   - Interpretting ROS messages
   - Commanding the BLDC chip

There are other components that will impact the design, but they will not drive the success or failure of the product (unless impacted by component shortages or by becoming obsolete).
These include:

- Connectors
- Passive components (resistors, capacitory, diodes, etc)
- Network components and amplifiers
- Power conditioning
- Power FETs

### Choosing key components, the BLDC chip

I started by reading papers and guides by manufacturers.
These guides have a sight bias as they are marketing the manufacturer's own components, but the value outweighs that bias.
For a small - medium scale manufacturer, the costs of design are a large aspect of total program cost.
This means a guide that suggests higher cost components may be an acceptable cost for the design time savings.

Reading papers from multiple manufacturers will help reduce the bias.
