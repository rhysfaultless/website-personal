Scoping a robotics project includes:

- Defining the application problem, and goal
- Defining a [Concept of Operations](https://www.nasa.gov/seh/appendix-s-concept-of-operations), of how your robotics system will perform tasks to accomplish the application goals
- Creating a Verification test plan, to check that the final system can perform the Concept of Operations
- Defining requirements for the system
- Creating a Validation test plan, to check that each requirement is met, or to document defficiencies
- Creating a Block Diagram, and possibly a wiring diagram
- Separating the system functions into Sub-systems, including requirements and functional tests
