# About

## About this site

I'm an engineer, and I try to be brief. I use many repositories for storing data, like GitHub, Trello, Jira, Confluence, and Google Docs. I hope that this site will allow me to create an index of all this data, and make it sharable where possible.

## What I write about

My main interests are innovation, and system design.
Refer to the Notes heading on this site for the range of topics I write about.
Content is related to my experience with these topics.
I will attempt to provide links and references for further reading, but overall this site should not be considered a complete knowledge base for the related subjects.
